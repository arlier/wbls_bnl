# check the chi2 distribution of PMTS2 with different calibration factors
use histogram with 50 bins,draw the NPE distribution of different calibration factors as illustrated in the below figure:

$chi^2$ and calibration factor scanning results of PMTs2,50bins.

NPE distribution of PMTs2 with different calibration factors.

The MC results are not in good consistent with the data, especially the first several bins.


For PMTs0, If the number of bins increase, we can see more fluctuation 
in the $\chi2^2$ distribution.

substract the minimum of $\chi^2$ and zoom in
