# data analysis of water phase

> check the factors using multiplicity-trig data

Once we get the calibration factors Qi , we can perform simulation for the
multiplicity events with these factors fixed. If the simulation of multiplicity events
have consistent results with data, these calibration factors are believed to be
reliable.

For the through-going muons, GEANT4
simulation can simulate the generation,
propagation of photons in the water, and
during the boundaries of acrylic vessel
and PMT. While the input parameters are
not perfectly measured.
.......................................
the attenuation length of water is
20+20
 m; the QE of PMTs is the
−10recommended value from vendor and
transparency of optical cookies are not
well measured; these uncertainties lead us
to ’calibrate’ the detector response.
