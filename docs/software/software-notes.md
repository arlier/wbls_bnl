# software and notes in this study
factors which will decide the N p.e distibution of each PMT:
- light source, energy deposition
- propagation (absorption, scattering)
- detection(view the acrylic,optical cookie and PMT as an effective or vitual
detector)

The cosmic muons can be viewed as a stable particle source, with stable flux and
energy for the time scope of experiment. we use CRY as the muon generator.

...............................................................................

Use GEANT4 to simulate the light propagation in water sonsidering the
absorptance of watwer, efficiency of optical cookie, QE of PMT, refraction and
reflection of acrylic vessel etc.

The simulation framework is ”rat-pac”2 , which is is intended to be a framework
that combines both Monte Carlo simulation of the Braidwood detector with
event-based analysis tasks, like reconstruction.
